# Word Search

Takes any .txt file with a list of words on the first line and any number 
of letters in two equal-length dimensions delineated by commas and finds
where the words are in x and y coordinates.

To run the app, type "gradle run" in the project directory. Then, simply 
take any file with the appropriate format and enter it into the console 
to get the coordinates of each word.
