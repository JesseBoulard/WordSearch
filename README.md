# Word Search

Takes any .txt file with a list of words on the first line and any number 
of letters in two equal-length dimensions delineated by commas and finds
where the words are in x and y coordinates.

To run the app, type "gradle run" in the project directory. Then, follow 
the directions in the console to get the coordinates of each word.
